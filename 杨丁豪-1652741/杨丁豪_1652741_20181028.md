## Paper Reading

**Dapper, a Large-Scale Distributed Systems Tracing Infrastructure**

### 1. Design goals

- **Low overhead**: the tracing system should have negligible performance impact on running services. In some highly optimized services even small monitoring overheads are easily noticeable, and might compel the deployment teams to turn the tracing system off.

- **Application-level transparency**: programmers should not need to be aware of the tracing system. A tracing infrastructure that relies on active collaboration from application-level developers in order to function becomes extremely fragile, and is often broken due to instrumentation bugs or omissions, therefore violating the ubiquity requirement.
- **Scalability**: it needs to handle the size of Google’s services and clusters for at least the next few years



### 2. Distributed Tracing

#### 2.1 Aggregate methods

How can each record of individual service logs be associated with a particular request?

- Black box methods: with machine learning
- **Annotation**

#### 2.2 Trace trees and spans

What's the type of Dapper's log record

Dapper records a human-readable span name for each span, as well as a span id and parent id

Spans created without a parent id are known as root spans. All spans associated with a specific trace also share a common trace id

### 3.  Sampling

#### 3.1 Strategy

- Use sampling to reduce performance overhead.

- Use adaptive sampling rate to adapt different conditions.

#### 3.2 Data collection

### 4. Application

- Monitor performance of new service deployment
- Infer dependencies between services
- Monitor anomaly



### 5.Shortcoming

- Coalescing effects
- Tracing batch workloads
- Finding a root cause
- Logging kernel-level information



## Future Work
