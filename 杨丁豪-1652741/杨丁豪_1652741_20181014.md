# A Brief Exploration of Pymicro

Oct.10, 2018 Dinghow Yang

## 0. Overview

My main job last week was to explore [Pymicro](https://github.com/rshriram/pymicro), a microservice-based sample application written in Python. The relevant documents are too brief, and I I have encountered many problems during the process, so I rewrote a more detail introduction of this application, which also contained other related knowledge.



## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Pymicro

A very rudimentary microservice-based application written using python's bottle.py. 

### 1.2 Zookeeper & Kazoo

Pymicro uses zookeeper & kazoo for service discovery. 

>[**ZooKeeper**](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.13/zookeeperStarted.html) is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications, which originating from Google Chubby.
>
>[**Kazoo**](https://kazoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python library designed to make working with [*Zookeeper*](https://kazoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-zookeeper) a more hassle-free experience that is less prone to errors.

### 1.3 Docker

> [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/) is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.



## 2. Configure Environment

### 2.1 Install Zookeeper & Kazoo

Zookeeper: https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.13/index.html

After download zookeeper, follow its document to **set its client port**, you should keep the port in `run_processes.sh` as the same.

Kazoo: `pip install kazoo`

Configure zookeeper:

```css
tickTime=2000
initLimit=10
dataDir=/Users/Downloads/zookeeper-3.4.13/data # The directory you want to store log file 
clientPort=2181
```

### 2.2 Run Pymicro

#### Without Docker

- Configure`run_processes.sh`
- `./run_processes.sh`

In this way, the default localhost port is **9997**, not 9080

#### With Docker

- Install Docker and regist
- Build from source in the pymicro directory`docker build -t rshriram/pymicro .`
- `./run_dockers.sh`

#### Testing

`curl -o - http://127.0.0.1:9080/bottle/all/view`



## 3. Read & Modify Source Code

### 3.1 Edit Microservices

In `server.py`

- Schema for microservice:

```
{name : service_name
path : node_path_in_zookeeper (and also the URL sub path)
children: array of microservices}
```

- Then add it in service_dict

### 3.2 Discovery Microservices

In `discovery.py`,  which uses the code from [microhackaton-2014](https://github.com/microhackaton-2014-august-warsaw/service-discovery-py/tree/master/service_discovery).

- Register microservices

```python
def register(self, service_name, address, port):
	...
    return instance_id
```

- Get instance or instances by name

```python
def get_instance(self, service_name):
    ...
    return random.choice(instances)

    def get_instances(self, service_name):
    ...
    return [self._instance_url(self._get_instance_definition(service_name, id)) for id in ids]
```
